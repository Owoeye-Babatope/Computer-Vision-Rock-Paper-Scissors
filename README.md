# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project simulates the rock paper scissors game played by 2 persons. 
In this case the computer plays against an user by matching the user's guess
if the user guesses rock over a lower ranks character such as paper or scissors
the user wins and vice versa.


## Technologies

The project depends on the following requirements (Python packages)

1. opencv
2. Tensorflow
3. Numpy
4. Pandas

## Files

The project contains five files which includes the readme

1. The Readme
2. The keras model which has been generated from the teachable(ML) Web app for use as a smile model.
3. The Label. Since the model was generated from a supervised data of rock, paper and scissors, hence each data has been labelled accordingly. and has been stored serially in the label.txt file.
4. The call_input runs the code to carryout the prediction using a live image taken from the camera of the user's computer
5. The manual_raps.py file is a simplified model simulating the graphical game in text
